# Capstone
This was the final project for my computer science degree. The code and visualizations were deployed to a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jbelian/Capstone/blob/master/app.ipynb). It is accompanied by a [write-up](/bus_ridership_forecasting.pdf) that demonstrate my professional capabilities in proposing and developing an application that employs machine-learning and predictive modeling.
